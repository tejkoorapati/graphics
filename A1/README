The final executable was compiled on this machine: gl08

How to invoke my program: ./game488


How to use my extra features: There are no extra features in this game. The basic functionality outlined in the assignment were followed.


I have created the following data files, which are in the data directory: There are no data files.


My program assumes the following: 
- Wired mode should display the colors for the face mode.
- New game does not change the view in anyway. The game is simply restarted.
- Reset view stops any persistence rotation.
- Mouse movements based rotations/scaling are not scaled on acceleration.
- When a game is over you may still do all view contorls, view menu options and control the speed (incase you want it for the next game).
- Persistence does not scale on speed of the mouse before release. If the speed passes a threshold, it will auto rotate at a constant speed in all cases.
- Game starts in face mode with medium speed.
